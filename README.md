# yt-comment-picker
PoC of a random YouTube comment picker for a raffle.

Build using Selenium.

Geckodriver is used but chromedriver can also be used. Just uncomment, comment the corresponding lines and adjust them.

The script has a very high runtime. The more it has to scroll down to load the comments, the longer it takes. For a one load comment section it took around 14 seconds to run.
